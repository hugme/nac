Nagios Configuration utility

This Utility will allow you to quickly make changes to your nagios
configuration by role, and then imprint that confguration on nagios
servers according to a list of facts about the servers.

It allows servers to be autopopulated into nagios though puppet.

It is built for a large infrastructure with multiple silos each
needing to be monitored seperatly.
